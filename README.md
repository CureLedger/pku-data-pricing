## 🚀 About CureLedger

CureLedger serves as infrastructure for health data marketplaces, enabling seamless coordination across chains and platforms. This repository is part of a larger vision to accelerate decentralized healthcare innovation while maintaining rigorous compliance with global standards.

Here, you'll find open-source components critical to CureLedger's functionality, including:

- **$DSCI Token**: An ERC20 utility token facilitating cross-chain transactions and data integrity.
- **Cypher Module**: Advanced cryptographic operations for ensuring privacy and security.

### 🌐 Interface with CureLedger

Developers can connect and build on CureLedger using our **RPC/API endpoints**. These endpoints allow seamless integration of external decentralized applications (dApps) with CureLedger. Access the API documentation [here](https://api.cureledger.org).
